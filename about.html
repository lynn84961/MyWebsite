  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Hi! I’m Lyu-Ting. I'm from Taipei, Taiwan, and am currently in the greater
      Seattle area, pursuing my master degree.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I'm currently a grad student major in Technology Innovation (MSTI) at
      University of Washington Global Innovation Exchange (GIX). During
      undergraduate, I majored in Computer Science, and have a dual degree of
      Digital Content & Technology (DCT). Before attending the graduate school,
      I was a research assistant and worked on a medical image processing
      project and held Python + OpenCV workshops for undergraduate students.
    </p>
    <h3>Interdisciplinary</h3>
    <p>
      Both MSTI and DCT are interdisciplinary programs. I learned my
      design, physical prototyping, and game programming skills while
      studying and working on projects in these programs. With my computer
      science background, these experiences form different areas allows me to
      think from other team members' perspective to better communicate with
      them, therefore making me a team player.
    </p>
    <h3>Hobby</h3>
    <p>
      During my free time, I dedicate myself to digital painting, doing fanarts
      for comics or movies that I like. I have been learning drawing on my own
      for more than 10 years. The self-learning experience enabled me to learn
      new skills fast. Painting also makes me a passionate and patient person
      that I always try my best to improve my works.
